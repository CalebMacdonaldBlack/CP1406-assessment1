##Goals
  The indended purpose of this website is to increase the attendence of young adults and highschoolers as cossieplay events and parties as well as increasing the amount of orders placed for new costumes.

##Success Evaluation
A current and previous history of addendence and ages will be recorded and compared with future attendence and ages. This will allow us to determine whether or not the website is accomplishing its goal of increasing the attendence of younger members at its events and parties. The current and previous history of costume orders will be recorded and compared with future orders aswell to determine if there has been an increase since the website was deployed.

##Target Audience
The target audience for this website will be young adults and highschoolers. The target audience will have interests in one or more of the following categories such as costume play, roleplaying, anime, manga,comic books, cartoons, video games and tv series. This audience will appeal to this website by being able to relate to the content and media. The website will have fun and exciting themes as well as social aspects to get the target audience more involved in cosplaying. 
It can be assumed the target audience is familiar will modern website design an be able to identify things such as icons, menus, dropdowns and other things. Cosplay attracts a broad range of ethnicities and after doing some research I determined that cosplay is biggest in Western and Asian culture (specifically Japan). Because of this the it might be invest in ensuring the website has multiple language options to cater to this audience.
